    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Ricardo J. Cantarero. I am a Computer Science and Mathematics Major at the Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences.</p>
    <p>
    Of significant interest to me is the ubiquitous – yet seemingly underappreciated – presence of technology in our daily lives. On a day-to-day basis, we are surrounded by intricate and complex embedded systems (in our cars, our televisions, and now even in some of our refrigerators), precarious legacy software systems (such as those written extensively in COBOL), desktop/web applications utilized by professionals in their fields (no matter how seemingly far removed from the realms of computing said fields are), and advanced networking systems that allow us to communicate all over the globe at all times of the day. However, most of us remain ignorant to the inner-workings of these technologies that aid in the perpetuation and maintaining of our societies in the 21st Century – in a manner of speaking, the average person is in possession of a fire that they use to warm and illuminate their environment, without the knowledge of its true physical nature.
    </p>
    <p> Therefore, one of my interests lie in understanding the technologies that allow humankind to succeed and proliferate, as I believe that erudition in the nature of the metaphorical fire, that tool that is itself seemingly perpetually proliferating, empowers individuals to lead more fulfilling lives in a world built on its utility.
    </p>
